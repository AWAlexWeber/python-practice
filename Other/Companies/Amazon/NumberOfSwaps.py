'''
Given an array and a sorting algorithm, the sorting algorithm will do a selection swap. Find the number of swaps to sort the array.

Example 1:
Input: [5, 4, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Swap index 0 with 1 to form the sorted array [4, 5, 1, 2].
Swap index 0 with 2 to form the sorted array [1, 5, 4, 2].
Swap index 1 with 2 to form the sorted array [1, 4, 5, 2].
Swap index 1 with 3 to form the sorted array [1, 2, 5, 4].
Swap index 2 with 3 to form the sorted array [1, 2, 4, 5].
